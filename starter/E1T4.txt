Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
In the current architecture, the free receipe doesn't need access for the free receipes bucket, which is a poor practice. Granting unnecessary access to s3 bucket is not advised.

# Poor practice 2
The webservice instance is public facing. This is poor security practice because there is no WAF or firwall implemented.
